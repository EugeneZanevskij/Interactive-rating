### What I learned

I got familiar with `:focus` selector.
It represents an element (such as a form input) that has received focus. It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element.

### Useful resources

- [:focus selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus) - This is a documentation on `:focus` selector.
